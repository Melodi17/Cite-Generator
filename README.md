# Cite Generator
 Automatically generate citations from links

## About
A personally useful project that i've used alot for converting a list of links into nicely-formatted citations.

## Usage
1. Download the repository.
2. Install the requirements from the requirements.txt file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script
```bash
python cite_generator.py
```
4. Select the entire link you want to reference in the text editor.
5. Press `control + alt + c` to get it replaced with a citation. Note it will take a second, and it will replace the original link. 
You can also use `control + alt + shift + c` to get an in-text citation the same way.
